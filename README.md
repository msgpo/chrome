Turtl for Chrome (deprecated)
=============================

This houses the source code for the old Turtl Chrome extension.

It has been replaced by the Chrome [bookmarking extension](https://github.com/turtl/chrome-bookmarker).
Instead of running Turtl in the browser, the new extension just sends
bookmarking data directly to the Turtl desktop app.
